# overview

winkill lets you temporarily disable the windows key on your keyboard without rebooting your computer.
click the winkill icon in the system tray to use it as a system-wide windows key disabler.

this is useful if you're always hitting the windows key when playing games, causing them to minimize.
(yes, i know not everyone does this, but some of us do)

# building

1. install Visual Studio 2015 for C++ (the Community Edition should work fine)
2. open WinKill.sln
3. compile and run

# screenshots

there's not much to it -- just a tray icon!
